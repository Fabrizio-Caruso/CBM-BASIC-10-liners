MINES by Fabrizio Caruso

The mine field:
You are in a minefield where mines appear both
- under your feet once you move and 
- around you (more if you do not move)
You can clear the area around you with anti-mine charges but you can only carry a maximum of 9.
You can obtain extra charges by reaching a "$" that appear at random positions on the screen.
The field has upper and lower borders that kill you if reached. Left and Right border wrap arround (as text would on the screen).

The rate of mines appearing around you, increases continuously.

Points:
- Walk into an empty position: 1 point
- Walk into a charge "$": 5 points

Goals:
- Reach the highest score possible by walking on empty positions or collecting charges "$"
- Avoid stepping on mines or the upper and lower borders. 
- Reach the next 100 points to get a full recharge of your anti-mine charges

Controls:
- Use I J K L to move 
- Use SPACE to clear nearby area (if you have enough charges)
